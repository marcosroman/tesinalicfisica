# tesinalicfisica2012

Part of the source code generated as part of my final project
to obtain the degree of Licenciado en Física
(roughly equivalent to Msc. in Physics)
at UNC (Universidad Nacional de Córdoba), 2012.

you can see [the library entry](https://famaf.biblio.unc.edu.ar//cgi-bin/koha/opac-detail.pl?biblionumber=16450).

The code is written in C, all plots and little movies where made with gnuplot+ffmpeg (sorry, lost them).
Comments in spanish.
